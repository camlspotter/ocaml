🐫 OCamleopard / 大麒麟 🐆
==================================

OCamleopard / 大麒麟 (or simply "+leopard") is a collection of small modifications to OCaml. Currently it includes:

* Variant constructor as curried/uncurried functions
* Haskell style value-type declaration
* Python like indentation rule
* Line comment
* Pattern guards
* Functions as infix operator
* SML style local name space
* η-expansion syntax sugar
* SML# style polymorphic records
* SML style user definable overloading

Variant constructor as functions
----------------------------------

For

```ocaml
type t = Foo of int * float
```

You can use the constructor like uncurried and curried functions:

```
Foo : (int * float) -> t
(Foo..) : int -> float -> t
```

See `README_curried_constr.md` for more details.

Haskell style value-type declaration
----------------------------------------

```
let f : 'a. 'a -> 'a 
and f x = x
```

See README_haskellish_type.md.


Python like indentation rule
----------------------------------

```
let f e =
  if e then:
    print_endline "true!";
    42
  else:
    print_endline "false!";
    -1
```

See README_indent.md

Line comment: `/// comment` 
----------------------------------

```
let x = 1 /// this is a line comment
```

See README_linecomment.md

Pattern guards 
--------------------------

```
match e with
| p with p' <- e' -> e'' (* you can use p' here *)
```

See README_pattern_guard.md

Function as infix operator: ``` ``div ```
-------------------------------

```
assert (24 ``div 8 = 3)
```

See README_backquote_infix.md

SML style local name space by ``let:``
------------------------------------------

```
let:
  type t = ...

  x = 1
  y = 2

  rec f x = ...
  and g x = ...
in
...
```

See README_sml_let.md and README_sml_let_indent.md

η-expansion syntax sugar
-----------------------------

```
let id x = x
let id2 = & id id   (* is for let id2 x = id id x *)
```

See README_eta.md

Polymorphic records
-----------------------------

SML# style polymorphic record:

```ocaml
let r = {. x = 1; y = ref 2 }   (* without type definition of the record *)
let () = print_int r..x
let () = r..y <- 3
```

See README_poly_record.md.

SML style overloading
-----------------------------

User definable overloaded values.

```ocaml
module Loaded = struct
  external (+) : 'a -> 'a -> 'a = "%OVERLOADED"
  module Int = struct
    let (+) = Pervasives.(+)
  end
  module Float = struct
    let (+) = Pervasives.(+.)
  end
end

open Loaded
let _ = 
  assert (1 + 2 = 3);
  assert (1.2 + 3.4 = 4.6) (* See it is not +. but + !!! *)
```

See README_overload.md.

Trivia of giraffes
============================

Giraffe was known as "cameleopardalis" by ancient Greeks and Romans 
who considered it was a hybrid of a camel and a leopard 
which had a camel's hump and leopard's coat patterns.

Giraffe was imported to ancient China by Zhèng Hé(鄭和)'s fleet in 1419.
The emperor named it "qílín"(麒麟) since its look had some similarity with
the description of the mystical sacred animal with the same name, 
which was believed to appear only when the country was led 
by a wise and merciful ruler. It seems that the emperor had some problem 
in his self-esteem just as we have.

The word "qílín" is still used for giraffe in Japan as キリン(Kirin) 
and Korea as 기린(I do not read Korean so I do not know the correct pronunciation.). 
Of course none in Japan or Korea believes the myth today.

The meaning of chinese character "大" is big, and can be pronounsed 
as "O" in Japanese. Therefore OCamleopard can be translated to "大麒麟",
"big sacred animal".

駱駝(camels) were rare in China capitals but Camelus bactrianus 
in the central asia were known better than 麒麟(giraffes), 
therefore they did not win the sacred status like giraffes, unfortunately.
