OCamleopard / 大麒麟 
==================================

OCamleopard / 大麒麟 (or simply +leopard) is a collection of small modifications 
to OCaml. Currently it includes:

* Variant constructor as functions: `(Some) : 'a -> 'a option`
* Haskell style value-type declaration: `let f : 'a. 'a -> 'a and f x = x`
* Python like indentation rule
* Line comment: `/// comment`
* Pattern guards `with p <- e ->`

Trivia of giraffes
-----------------------------------

Giraffe was known as "cameleopardalis" by ancient Greeks and Romans 
who considered it was a hybrid of a camel and a leopard 
which had a camel's hump and leopard's coat patterns.

Giraffe was imported to ancient China by Zhèng Hé(鄭和)'s fleet in 1419.
The emperor named it "qílín"(麒麟) since it resembled with the description 
of the mystical sacred animal with the same name, which was believed 
to appear only when the country was leaded by a wise and merciful ruler. 
The word "qílín" is still used for giraffe in Japan as キリン(Kirin) 
and Korea as 기린.

The meaning of chinese character "大" is big, and can be pronounsed 
as "O" in Japanese. Therefore OCamleopard can be translated to "大麒麟",
"big sacred animal".

駱駝(camels) were rare in China capitals but Camelus bactrianus 
in the central asia were known better than 麒麟(giraffes), 
therefore they did not win the sacred status like giraffes, unfortunately.
