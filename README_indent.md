indent : OCaml + indentation rule
====================================

This small patch provides Python like indentation rules to OCaml:

* 100% backward compatible
* Indentation rule is only introduced by Python like special keywords: `with:`, `then:`, `else:`, `do:`, `function:` etc.

Example
====================================

Special keywords end with `:` introduce implicit blocks based on 
the code indentation.

The following program using two special keywords `then:` and `else:`:

```ocaml
let f e =
  if e then:
    print_endline "true!";
    42
  else:
    print_endline "false!";
    -1
in
...
```

is equivalent to the original OCaml code below:

```ocaml
let f e = 
  if e then begin              (* <- begin inserted *)
    print_endline "true!";
    42
  end else begin               (* <- end and begin inserted *)
    print_endline "false!";
    -1
  end                          (* <- end inserted *)  
in
...
```

This Python style `xxx:` keywords are introduced all the paired keywords
like `do` and `done`, `object` and `end`, etc. and all the open keywords
without the corresponding closings such as `match .. with`, `try .. with`,
`funciton`.

`do:` does not require the paired `done`:

```ocaml
for i = 1 to 100 do:
  print_int i;                   (* you still need to type ; *)
print_endline "printed 100"      (* lowering indent implicitly closes do: *)
```

is equilvalent with

```ocaml
for i = 1 to 100 do
  print_int i;
done;
print_endline "printed 100"
```

`with:` introduces implicit `begin` and `end`, useful in nested matches:

```ocaml
match xs with
| [] ->
  match y with:    (* introduces implicit begin *)
  | A -> 2
  | B -> 3
| x::xs ->         (* lowering indent implicitly closes the begin *)
  match y with:    (* introduces implicit begin *)
  | A -> 4
  | B -> 5         (* EOF implicitly closes the begin *)
```
                       
is equlivalent with  

```ocaml
match xs with
| [] ->
  begin match y with
  | A -> 2
  | B -> 3
  end
| x::xs ->
  begin match y with
  | A -> 4
  | B -> 5
  end
```
You can see more samples at `testsuite/indent/indent_test.ml`.

Special keywords
====================================

Auto-insertion of `begin` .. `end` for the following keywords:

* `with:`, `then:`, `else:`, `function:` and `lazy:`

Auto-insertion of the corresponding ending keywords for the following:

* `do:` (`done` is not required)
* `sig:`, `struct:`, `object:` (`end` is not required)

When the implicit closings are inserted?
===========================================

The implicit closing of a special keyword `xxx:` happens when 
the indentation level goes to *less than* or *equal to* 
the indentation level where the special keyword is introduced:

```ocaml
for i = 0 to 100 do:         (* indent level 0 *)
  print_int i;               (* level 2 *)
print_endline "printed 100!" (* back to 0, we must close the do: *)
```

is equivalent to

```ocaml
for i = 0 to 100 do
  print_int i;
done;
print_endline "printed 100!"
```

Note that this is not the horizontal level of the special keyword:

```ocaml
match x with
  p -> function:   (* indent level 2 at p. Not 7 at function: *)
    | A -> 1       (* level 4. No closing happens *) 
    | B -> 2
| q -> ...         (* Level 0. *)
```

is equvalient with

```ocaml
match x with
  p -> begin function
    | A -> 1
    | B -> 2
    end
| q -> ...
```

Indentation of the line starts with `|`
------------------------------------------

The indentation level of the line which starts with the vertical bar `|` 
for the pattern matches is treated a bit differently, in order to support
the common indentation convention of or-patterns: they are often leveled
at the same with `match`, `funciton` and `try`. 

At the lines starts with `|`, the auto closing only happens when their
indentation levels are *strictly less than* those of the lines with 
the corresponding special keywords:

```ocaml
let rec f x = 
  match x mod 3, x mod 5 with:    (* level 2. Introduces an implicit begin. *)
  | 0, 0 -> print_string "fizbuz" (* level 2. This does not close the implicit begin *)
  | 0, _ -> print_string "fiz"    (* level 2. *)
  | _, 0 -> print_string "buz"    (* level 2. *)
  | _ -> print_int x;             (* level 2. *)
  f (x+1)                         (* level 2. Start not with |. with: must be closed *)
```

is equivalent to

```ocaml
let rec f x = 
  begin match x mod 3, x mod 5 with
  | 0, 0 -> print_string "fizbuz"
  | 0, _ -> print_string "fiz"
  | _, 0 -> print_string "buz"
  | _ -> print_int x;
  end;
  f (x+1)
```

Handling of `;`
------------------------------------------

If `;` symbol for sequential execution `e1; e2` appears at the end of a line
and implicit closing happens just after this line, then the `;` is treated
as if it is after the closing:

```ocaml
for i = 0 to 100 do:
  print_int i;                   (* ; appears at the end of do: indentation block *)
print_endline "printed 100!"
```
            
is equilvalent with

```ocaml
for i = 0 to 100 do
  print_int i;
done;                            (* ; is used to sequence the next line *)
print_endline "printed 100!"
```

Note
====================================

`xxx:` must be at the end of lines
-------------------------------------

After the special keywords, you must immediately change the line:

```ocaml
match e1 with: p -> e2
```

is rejected as a syntax error. You can still write comments:

```ocaml
match e1 with: (* special keyword! *)
| p -> e2
```

is ok.

Attributes
-------------------------------------

Special `xxx:` keywords whose original versions can take attributes
are also able to take attributes, after `:` signs changing the line:

```ocaml
function:
[@blahblah]
| p -> e
```

The line changing is mandatory. `function: [@blahblah]` may look better 
but it is not possible for the current implementation approach 
as a simple lexer level converter.

Behind the scene
====================================

This hack uses 'Lexer preprocessor', which is introduced in OCaml 4.02.0
in `lexer.mll`. There is a function `Lexer.set_preprocessor` to push 
your own lexer level filter between the lex token stream and the parser.
There is no way to use this from the command line, and you need to modify
the compiler but it seems easy to use. (Except that the preprocessor receives
`EOL` tokens at each end of line, unlike the original lex token streams.)

To make the hack around implicit `begin` introduction as simple as possible,
some syntaxes are extended. For example, the following is valid with this patch:

```ocaml
match x mod 3, x mod 5 with begin (* begin after with *)
| 0, 0 -> print_string "fizbuz"
| 0, _ -> print_string "fiz"
| _, 0 -> print_string "buz"
| _ -> print_int x;
end
```

This variant is actually used for the desugared version of `match ... with:`.
Technically, for lexer based filter, it is hard to insert `begin` in front 
of `match` when it sees `with:` in its token stream.

Future work?
====================================

* More tests

* `let:` (`let: rec` or `let rec:` ?)

     Is it really required? `in`-less `let` in Haskell's `do` 
     has no serious meaning to me.

* `begin:` and `(:`

     Uh, oh.
